# Acute Myocardial Infarction Mortality Rate Analysis

## Overview
The code alltogether analyzes the acute myocradiat infraction (AMI) mortality rate through differing regions with a stratification of both gender and race per each region. First, the code filters the needed data and produces the needed visualization along with the statitical analysis to detemine its statistical signifance. Then, the code statistically analyzed the stratified data from using an ANOVA test. Hence, providing the results needed to determine the possible correlations between AMI among regions differing race and gender.

## Findings
The unstratified analysis revealed statistically significant differences in AMI mortality rates across the four major U.S. regions, with the South and Midwest having the highest rates, and the West and Northeast having the lowest rates (F-statistic = 3.99, p-value = 0.013). When stratified by race/ethnicity, the analysis showed no significant regional differences for Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and Other race groups. However, for non-Hispanic whites, there were statistically significant regional disparities (F-statistic = 4.51, p-value = 0.007). The gender-stratified analysis found significant regional variations in AMI mortality for both males (F-statistic = 3.726, p-value = 0.0175) and females (F-statistic = 4.615, p-value = 0.00654), with the South consistently exhibiting the highest rates.


These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence highlighting geographic and demographic disparities in cardiovascular health outcomes within the United States. While regional variations in AMI mortality have been previously documented, this analysis provides updated estimates for 2020 and stratifies the data by important demographic factors like race/ethnicity and gender. The identification of the South as a high-risk region across all stratifications aligns with known patterns of higher cardiovascular disease burden in this part of the country.


## Implications of the Findings
These findings have important implications for policymakers, public health officials, and healthcare providers. Policymakers could use the results to prioritize targeted interventions and resource allocation to address the elevated AMI mortality risk in the Southern region. From a public health perspective, campaigns and community-based programs should be tailored to the specific needs and cultural contexts of high-risk regions and demographic groups, promoting lifestyle modifications and early detection of cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, Healthcare providers should be aware of these disparities and consider implementing tailored screening and management strategies for AMI risk based on patients' geographic location and demographic characteristics. Further research is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these disparities, including factors related to healthcare access, socioeconomic determinants, and regional differences in risk factor prevalence and management. To add on, there should be more research looking into race and AMI mortality rates since there were differences but not statistically significant which could be due to the sample being used and could also investigate AMI among Asian individuals. By addressing these geographic and demographic disparities in AMI mortality, policymakers and healthcare stakeholders can work towards achieving more equitable cardiovascular health outcomes across the United States.


## Access and Purpose of the dataset
The dataset used was collected for the National Vital Statistics System which is a national database system to distribute national vital statistics. This specific database called the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance Data was organized by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention(National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) - national cardiovascular disease surveillance data). It can be downloaded and accessed through the CDC’s database. The database was retired in April 2024 as it specifically focused on data from 2000 to 2020. The primary use of the database was to investigate and determine trends and data mortality rates of heart disease and stroke for adults within those two decades.
